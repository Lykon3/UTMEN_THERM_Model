# Theory Overview

This document outlines the foundational logic behind the UTMEN/THRM structure. It describes the modelâ€™s core assumption:
tension, energy, and information are not just metaphors but structurally entangled tensor dimensions with recursive feedback behavior.

Topics covered:
- Recursive tensor fields
- Emergent physical coherence
- High-dimensional topologies
- Applications to symbolic AI, law, finance, and geometry
