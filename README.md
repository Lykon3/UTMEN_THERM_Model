### Summary

This repository contains the source files, figures, and full archive for the UTMEN/THRM model — a theoretical structure unifying:

- **Membrane Tension (T⁽ˣ⁾)**
- **Energy Exchange Vectors (E⁽ˣ⁾)**
- **Information Flow Structures (I⁽ˣ⁾)**

These elements satisfy a **Triple-Resonance Condition**, governing recursive geometry in physical systems ranging from black hole evaporation to plasma coherence.

### Included Files

- `main.tex` – Full LaTeX manuscript  
- `figure1.png`, `figure2.png` – Visuals of recursive geometry  
- `README.txt` – Developer notes  
- `UTMEN_THERM_Model_Archive.zip` – Full arXiv-ready package

### Status

- **Submitted for endorsement** under `math-ph` on arXiv  
- **Timestamped: April 2025**

Additional Work

This project is part of a broader exploration of recursive intelligence systems, symbolic parsing, and applied interface design. Parallel files in this repository reflect prototype engines, manuscript fragments, and front-end app experiments (via Streamlit) that stem from UTMEN's core architecture.

While UTMEN centers on recursive physical coherence, these documents explore how similar principles can structure legal, financial, and interpretive domains.
