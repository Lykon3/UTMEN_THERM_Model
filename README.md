### Summary

This repository contains the source files, figures, and full archive for the UTMEN/THRM model — a theoretical structure unifying:

- **Membrane Tension (T⁽ˣ⁾)**
- **Energy Exchange Vectors (E⁽ˣ⁾)**
- **Information Flow Structures (I⁽ˣ⁾)**

These elements satisfy a **Triple-Resonance Condition**, governing recursive geometry in physical systems ranging from black hole evaporation to plasma coherence.
